## Overview

When browsing job listings on SEEK, some jobs are marked as "Featured" to boost visibility, cluttering the job search experience for others. This script identifies and removes these "Featured" listings from SEEKâ€™s search results, displaying only organic job posts.

## Features

- **Removes "Featured" Ads**: Hides all job ads marked as "Featured" on SEEK.
- **Support for Dynamic Content**: Continually checks for and removes new "Featured" ads that load dynamically as you scroll.
- **Works on NZ and AU Domains**: Supports both `seek.com.au` (Australia) and `seek.co.nz` (New Zealand).
